# Github-Aggregator

## New features to be introduced

* CSV or excel File to download the results of the input provided
* Website design improvement
* Create a new table so that we can isolate the repo_name and all the domains that lie under it. The old table will consist of only repo_name,     total contributions & unique contributors from different domains. Only one row for each repo name should be displayed upon running the flask application
